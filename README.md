If you want to test the survey, just change the connect info to your phonebook DB and change the table in postme.php to your tablename

I renamed the file that was previously "index.php" to "survey.php" as the survey didn't make sense for the landing spot for the website.  

Please make the index.php file into a Z pattern (see the citation at the bottom for an example--the structure is very similar to my midterm) and the disney_info.php file into an F pattern (again, see the citation at the bottom this file is pretty much exactly the same as my midterm).

I was also wondering how many of these php files are actually necessary?  I'm pretty sure it reflects badly on the IA if everything's muddied up with unnecessary files and such.
