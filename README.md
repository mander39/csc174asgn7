* Update I no longer mind what patterns you make with the content--I thought that was a tandem grade for IA and designer but apparently it's just the designer so do what you think is best.

* I added questions to the survey in the survey.js but I didn't update the part in the bottom of the file in the ".add()" part.  I also haven't updated the dbphp files or the database as I thought it'd be quicker and easier for you to fix that part Michael since you've been working on it and it's part of the coder work.  Sorry I didn't realize we needed more than one question until this afternoon.

*  If you want to test the survey, just change the connect info to your phonebook DB and change the table in postme.php to your tablename.
