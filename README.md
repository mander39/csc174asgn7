Hey Shawn--when you finish up the design would you mind making the information on the parks into an F pattern and putting the content under the "more" section up in the "home" part of the index so that that part looks like a Z pattern and the primary landing spot is the button to take a survey?  I'm worried that otherwise the choreography I had in mind and tried to explain in the readme earlier won't be clear.  Thanks!

*  If you want to test the survey, just change the connect info to your phonebook DB and change the table in postme.php to your tablename.
