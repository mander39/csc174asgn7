*  If you want to test the survey, just change the connect info to your phonebook DB and change the table in postme.php to your tablename
* For IA, to change the survey topic go into the index.js file, you can adjust survey components - get the code from https://surveyjs.io/create-survey/ and go to the JSON tab. Adjustments will have to be made to the DB / posting code if we add more than 1 question.


I renamed the file that was previously "index.php" to "survey.php" as the survey didn't make sense for the landing spot for the website.  

Please make the index.php file into a Z pattern (see the citation at the bottom for an example--the structure is very similar to my midterm) and the disney_info.php file into an F pattern (again, see the citation at the bottom this file is pretty much exactly the same as my midterm).
